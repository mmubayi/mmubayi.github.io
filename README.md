# Maya Mubayi

<p> A place for me to share things I’ve done, things I’ve worked on, and things that are still under development. </p>

### About Me
I'm passionate about developing user-centered products on both the back-end and front-end, and working through the entire process with a UX perspective to help design, create, and evaluate the final product. I am a keen problem-solver and always eager to learn from new resources and experiences.

Outside of that, I enjoy learning languages, discussing health and wellness, reading exciting Wikipedia articles, and getting to work collaboratively with others.

I'm currently seeking full-time software engineering positions where I can apply the skills I've developed, as well as cultivate new skills by working on exciting products in a dynamic and engaging setting!
